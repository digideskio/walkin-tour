From 1914 to 1932, Galleani's followers in the United States carried out a series of bombings and assassination attempts against institutions and persons they viewed as class enemies.","You have shown no pity to us! We will do likewise. We will dynamite you!— Anarchist warning, 1919.","On a warm September day in 1920, a few months after the arrest of his comrades Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (“the best friends I have in America”), a vengeful Italian immigrant anarchist named Mario Buda parked his horse-drawn wagon near the corner of Wall and Broad streets, next to the new federal Assay Office and directly across from J. P. Morgan and Company. The Morgan partners, including the great Thomas Lamont and Dwight Morrow (Charles Lindbergh’s future father-in-law), were discussing weighty financial matters in a lower-floor conference room. Perhaps Buda tipped his cap in the direction of the unsuspecting robber barons before he nonchalantly climbed down and disappeared unnoticed into the lunchtime crowd. A few blocks away, a startled letter-carrier found strange, crudely printed leaflets warning: “Free the Political Prisoners or it Will Be Sure Death for All of You!” They were signed: “American Anarchist Fighters.”<br>
Buda, aka “Mike Boda,” was a veteran supporter of Luigi Galleani, anarchist theorist and editor of Cronaca Sovversiva (“Subversive Chronicle”), which the Department of Justice in 1918 had condemned as “the most dangerous newspaper in this country.” The Galleanisti (probably never more than 50 or 60 hardcore activists) were chief suspects in various dynamite plots, including the notorious Preparedness Day bombing in San Francisco in 1916 (for which union organizers Tom Mooney and Warren Billings were framed) and the letter bombs sent to prominent members of the Wilson administration as well as J. P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller in June 1919. The Cronaca Sovversiva reading circles that met in the shadows of Paterson silk factories and Youngstown steel mills—not unlike certain contemporary Quran study groups in gritty neighborhoods of Brooklyn and south London—were lightning rods for immigrant alienation; an alienation that grew into rage in the face of wartime anti-foreign hysteria, which resulted
in the so-called Palmer Raids in 1919 against radicals of all denominations. When Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer signed Galleani’s deportation order in February 1919, anonymous flyers appeared in New England factories promising to “annihilate” the deporters “in blood and fire.”<br>
As Buda, who had appointed himself the avenging angel of the imprisoned and deported anarchists, made his escape from Wall Street, the bells of nearby Trinity Church began to toll noon. Before they had stopped, the wagon packed with high explosive (probably blasting gelatin stolen from a tunnel construction site) and iron slugs erupted in a huge ball of fire, leaving a large crater in Wall Street. Windows exploded in the faces of office workers, pedestrians were mowed down by metal shrapnel or scythed by shards of glass, building awnings and parked cars caught fire, and a suffocating cloud of smoke and debris enshrouded Wall Street. Skyscrapers quickly emptied. Panicked crowds fled past crumpled bodies on the sidewalks, some of them writhing in agony. On the treeless street, green leaves bearing presidents’ portraits—some of the estimated $80,000 in cash abandoned by terrified or wounded bank messengers—fluttered with each choking gust of wind and ash. No one knew whether more explosions would follow, and frightened authorities suspended trading at the Stock Exchange for the first time in history.<br>
An attack on Wall Street, of course, was immediately construed as
a national emergency. One hundred regular soldiers, rifles loaded and bayonets fixed, were sent quickly from Governor’s Island to guard the badly damaged Assay Office and adjacent Subtreasury, while America’s chief sleuth, William Flynn, the head of the (federal) Bureau of Investigation, was dispatched from Washington on the first available train. Over the next few days, the NYPD’s Detective Bureau assembled the grotesque remains of
an “infernal machine”: a horse’s head, some severed hoofs, and the twisted metal of a wagon axle. Anarchists, the IWW, and the new-fangled Bolsheviki all automatically became suspect and the New York Times soon screamed “Red Plot Seen in Blast.” While police and federal investigators focused on “celebrity” Reds such as labor-organizer Carlo Tresca, Buda quietly made his way home to Italy. (It is unknown whether other Galleanisti participated in the organization of the bombing or whether Buda was an astonishing one- man show.)<br>
Meanwhile, the coroner was counting 40 dead (some mangled beyond recognition), with more than 200 injured, including Equitable Trust’s president Alvin Krech and J. P. Morgan Jr’s son Junius. Joseph P. Kennedy, walking in the street, was badly shaken but unharmed. Buda was undoubtedly disappointed when he learned that “Jack” Morgan himself was away in Scotland at his hunting lodge, and that his partners Lamont and Morrow were unscathed. Nonetheless, a poor immigrant with some stolen dynamite, a pile of scrap metal, and an old horse had managed to bring unprecedented terror to the inner sanctum of American capitalism.",

disease only served to increase his sales potential. He was already one of
the most visible photographers in the world, and during the past decade his work had been the subject of sixty-nine one-person shows, five books, and fifteen catalogues. But AIDS would soon catapult him into another realm

Prices often escalate after an artist’s death—“the deader, the better” goes the art world saying—so Mapplethorpe’s terminal illness had, according
to Read, created a “built-in market condition,” whereby people purchased Mapplethorpe photographs in anticipation of his demise. “AIDS,” Read said, “had a terrific influence.”
Lisa Lyon recalled a photography dealer calling her up to see if she’d sell some of her Mapplethorpe photographs from Lady. “The dealer said, ‘You know, Robert’s dead,’” she explained, “so I immediately got crazy and said, ‘What do you mean he’s dead?’ Then the dealer told me, ‘Well, he’s dead ... in terms of the market.’”",

I was staggered when old-timer Harlemites told me that while this immigrant musical chairs game had been going on, Negroes had been in New York City since 1683, before any of them came, and had been ghettoed all over the city. They had first been in the Wall Street area; then they were pushed into Greenwich Village. The next shove was up to the Pennsylvania Station area. And men, the last stop before Harlem, the black ghetto was concentrated around 52nd Street, which is how 52nd Street got the Swing Street name and reputation that lasted long after the Negroes were gone.<br>
Then, in 1910, a Negro real estate man somehow got two or three Negro families into one Jewish Harlem apartment house. The Jews flew from
that house, then from that block, and more Negroes came in to fill their apartments. Then whole blocks of Jews ran, and still more Negroes came uptown, until in a short time, Harlem was like it still is today—virtually all black.",

If you play by the rules of this game, people will tend to ignore you. There is a particular glaze that comes over the eyes of New Yorkers when they walk through the streets, a natural and perhaps necessary form of indifference to others. It doesn’t matter how you look, for example. Outrageous costumes, bizarre hairdos, T-shirts with obscene slogans printed across them—no one pays attention to such things. On the other hand, the way you act inside your clothes is of the utmost importance. Odd gestures of any kind are automatically taken as a threat. Talking out loud to yourself, scratching your body, looking someone directly in the eye: these deviations can trigger off hostile and sometimes violent reactions from those around you. You must not swagger or swoon, you must not clutch the walls, you must not sing, for all forms of spontaneous or involuntary behavior are sure to elicit stares, caustic remarks, and even an occasional shove or kick in the shins.

and the soul toward the cobra's tongue.<br>Every day in New York, they slaughter<br>
four million ducks,<br>
five million hogs,<br>
two thousand pigeons to accommodate the tastes of the dying, one million cows,<br>
one million lambs,<br>
and two million roosters<br>
that smash the sky to pieces.<br>
<br>
It's better to sob while honing a blade<br>
or kill dogs on the delirious hunts<br>
than to resist at dawn<br>
the endless milk trains,<br>
the endless blood trains<br>
and the trains of roses, manacled<br>
by the dealers in perfume.<br>
The ducks and the pigeons,<br>
and the hogs and the lambs<br>
lay their drops of blood<br>
under the multiplications,<br>
and the terrified bellowing of the cows wrung dry<br>
fills the valley with sorrow<br>
where the Hudson gets drunk on oil.<br><br>

I denounce everyone<br>
who ignores the other half,<br>
the half that can't be redeemed,<br>
who lift their mountains of cement<br>
where the hearts beat<br>
inside forgotten little animals<br>
and where all of us will fall<br>
in the last feast of pneumatic drills.<br>
I spit in all your faces.<br>
The other half hears me,<br>
devouring, pissing, flying in their purity,<br>
like the supers' children in lobbies<br>
who carry fragile twigs<br>
to the emptied spaces where<br>
the insect antennae are rusting.<br>
This is not hell, but the street.<br>
Not death, but the fruit stand.<br>
There is a world of tamed rivers and distances just beyond our grasp<br>
in the cat's paw smashed by a car,<br>
and I hear the earthworm's song<br>
in the hearts of many girls.<br>
Rust, fermentation, earth tremor.<br>
<br><br>
You yourself are the earth as you drift in office numbers.<br>
What shall I do now? Set the landscapes in order?<br>
Order the loves that soon become photographs,<br>
that soon become pieces of wood and mouthfuls of blood?<br>
No, no: I denounce it all.<br>
I denounce the conspiracy<br>
of these deserted offices<br>
that radiate no agony,<br>
that erase the forest's plans,<br>
and I offer myself as food for the cows wrung dry<br>
when their bellowing fills the valley<br>
where the Hudson gets drunk on oil.<br>",

Such edifices would be longstanding but noble, such that when they eventually crumbled, a thousand years hence, their broken columns and tumbled-down stone walls would convey a message of glorious achievement followed by decay. ","The Empire State embodies its own kind of technotopian dream: not the genocidal Nazi fantasy, of course, but an extended celebration of machine logic and the forces of capital. The building achieves, in its smooth and hygienic Huxleyan fashion, a totalitarian ideal of command and control, the inexorable logic of assembly line and social engineering. The building is all about vertical space, and in Manhattan’s force-grown grid, space is money: upward is not upward for its own sake, but for the sake of possibility and profit. On the cramped Manhattan street plan, there is nowhere else to go, and so the skyscraper was born. The Empire State’s relation to the grid is therefore symbiotic, born of its pressures but also exploiting its conduits, the streets and pipes and gas lines that tangle beneath its surface. It is a node growing, massing, developing in the entire network of power and commodity, rising like a magic tower from sheer force of energy concentrated below.",,

As men, gay men had less need to justify their presence on the streets, but they took advantage of the same legitimizing conventions. One man who had indicated his interest in meeting another might stop before a window and gaze at the display; the second could then join him and strike up a conversation in which they could determine whether they wanted to spend more time together. “Fairies hang out in the saloon opposite Bloomingdale’s,” a Macy’s saleswoman claimed in 1913, and, she added, the blocks of Third Avenue in the East Fifties, a marginal retail strip under the El, were “their favorite beat.” A study of arrests for homosexual activity in 1921 provides further evidence of the extent to which cruising was concentrated in retail shopping districts, for it revealed that the subway stations at Lexington and Fifty-ninth Street where Bloomingdale’s stood, Union Square (the site of numerous cheap retail outlets), and Herald Square where Macy’s, Gimbels, and Saks-34th Street were located, each accounted for more arrests than any other station, all together accounted for three-quarters of the arrests reported for all subway stations.",

A few flagrantly exhibitionistic fairies are able to make a living through the sexual gratification of men who are interested in their type of service. Ordinarily, however, the hustler is the one who is paid by the “queen,” “bitch,” “fag,” or “fairy”—that is, by an effeminate exhibitionist who not only brazenly proclaims his homosexuality to the interested, but attempts to force it on the notice of others. Like the female prostitute, the effeminate male prostitute has a more masculine male prostitute somewhere in the offing to whom he contributes and who serves as his protector. Sometimes these protectors are gangsters. Emotional attachments between fairies of Santos’ type and their protectors are ephemeral affairs.

","Let’s suppose you are in a real city and you are a man and you are walking down the street, in the thick of the crowd. Glancing up from the pavement, for just a moment, you notice a man walking in your direction and he’s staring straight at you. Not every man fixes his stare before his feet at this violet
hour, it seems. You don’t. His stare hits you right between your eyes. And not for the first time. You recognize him. He has looked at you in this way before—and he has seen you see him do this before. Let’s say he is about your age (whatever age that is) and he is wearing a suit, like you. You two could be twins, in the dark.
<br><br>                        
You don’t know why, or rather, you don’t at this particular moment ask yourself why, but you hold the gaze of this man who is now walking closer
to you and who refuses not to look. Seconds pass, perhaps as many as five
or six, but it seems like longer. Time slows down for you, as it always does in situations like these. In an instant, the gaze between you two is broken—you look down, or perhaps he looks away. Maybe someone passes between you, or something else diverts your attention. It’s noisy, with the sound of horns and motors, but it could be anything. As quickly as the moment came upon you,
it is lost. Almost. You look back, behind you, and see that he, too, is looking back behind him.        
<br><br>        
You are hurrying ... in order to catch a train because you have a family to go home to, a ready-made microwave meal awaits, probably kids, the lot. You don’t want to be late, not again, not again this week anyway. You look forward to your train journey, because this is your time, your very own time, the time between two lives, someone might say.
<br><br>                                                        
On the train home, settled into your seat, and for reasons you cannot explain to yourself or for reasons you really don’t understand, the man on the street—your man on the street, handsome with a nice suit—comes back into your mind. He was never very far out of your mind, if truth be told. You are going a little red in the cheeks at the thought of it, even now. Did you go red in the cheeks when he was looking at you? Was it the blush of shame or the blush of desire? Do you know the difference between shame and desire? These are questions you could ask yourself, but don’t.
<br><br>                                                        
Instead, you wonder if one day this man will speak to you. Speak to me, you think. Why do you never speak? What are you thinking? I never know what you are thinking.
<br><br>                                                        
Can we talk about a network of cruisers rather than occasional and seemingly isolated, if not accidental, encounters?

While walking the street, my gaze would be riveted on stalwart adolescents, and I would have to look back at the handsomest that passed. If a street-
car conductor happened to be youthful and good-looking, I became almost irrational. With a look of despair I would gaze insolently and imploringly into the face of the blue-clad youth as if I would compel him to read my thoughts, since I did not dare give them expression. When in a crowded car he brushed against me in passing, a tremor would pass over my body. Youthful policemen also at this time particularly fascinated me. Blue clothing and brass buttons have always made a young man appear to me as at his best.
<br><br>                                                        
“So we are taking off our masks, are we, and keeping / our mouths shut? As if we’d been pierced by a glance”—that later leads us to “the merits of each / of the latrines. 14th Street is drunken and credulous, / 53rd tries to tremble but is too at rest.”
<br><br>                                                        
What does it mean when two men look at each other in the streets of the modern city?
<br><br>                                                        
Mere eye contact and an exchange of words.
<br><br>                                                        
Reciprocal gazes may hold their own pleasures for some, and the dynamics of the gaze may be erotic and stimulating precisely because it does not end in sex.
<br><br>                                                        
This chance encounter—“the magnetism of our meeting.” The cruiser queers the flâneur.
<br><br>                                                        
Cruising is a practice that exploits the ambivalence of the modern city, and in so doing, “queers” the totalizing narratives of modernity, in particular, flânerie.
<br><br>                                                        
There’s an art to cruising and it has a lot to do with timing and with the eyes. Take eyes first. You’re walking down the street and you pass a man going in the opposite direction. Your eyes lock but you both keep on moving. After
a few paces you glance back and see that the man has stopped and is facing a store window but looking in your direction. If he’s not exactly the partner you’re searching for you’ll probably register the compliment his stare is paying you but leave it at that.
<br><br>                                                        
But if he does catch your fancy you may go through the little charade
of examining the shop window nearest you. After a bit, the frequency and intensity of exchanged glances will increase and one of you will stroll over to the other. There are a few safe and stock opening lines banal to the point of absurdity ... After these preliminaries you may extend your hand, introduce yourself, ask him his name and suggest you have a drink together. ",

A 1965 Newsweek article described the East Village by telling readers to ""head east from Greenwich Village, and when it starts to look squalid, around the Bowery and Third Avenue, you know you're there.""",A few recreational facilities were provided for the blasé and the detumescent; the rest of the building was devoted to sex. There were nine floors. ,"A few recreational facilities were provided for the blasé and the detumescent; the rest of the building was devoted to sex. There were nine floors. The first floor was the entrance, the second contained offices, the third the lockers; the next three floors housed the “rooms” and a TV room and gym; the floor above consisted of a communal shower and sauna; up more stairs to the Truck Stop, and the top floor contained so-called Fantasy Rooms.
<br><br>					
If “baths” is a misnomer, so is “rooms.” They were no more than cubicles, a double row of them encircled by a corridor, at least 30 on each floor. On the outer side of the corridor was blank wall—no windows anywhere, one was boxed in, secluded, secure—and the occasional uninviting lavatory and washroom. A cubicle was only large enough for a mattress and a chair. Most of the doors were closed, either because the tenant was busy elsewhere or because the room was occupied by a couple at work.
<br><br>				
But some of the doors were open. In some cubicles the dim light exhibited a man languidly staring out into the corridor while he fondled his penis or otherwise displayed his best features to those who passed by. Some of these men looked battle-weary, but they must have been game for another bout, or else they’d have closed the door and taken a recuperative nap. In others men lay on their stomachs baring their buttocks. I was puzzled by the constant availability of the inmate of one cubicle. He as a lithe creature, with a mop of very dark hair and a shapely bottom—but his door was always open and it was clear no one wanted him.

Although these sexual invitations are transparent enough, they are not of course entirely open. The prospective partner lingers on the threshold and the two men look each other over and decide whether or not to commit unnatural acts. The succession of opening and closing doors implied considerable sexual athleticism, a determination to cram in as many sex acts as your body can take and muster. The silence in the air was punctuated with the grunts and cries of the compatible, but was also filled with the stillness of the undesired, hopelessly exhibiting their negligible charms to a parade of passers-by. In odd recesses stood couples of more exhibitionist inclination. One youth, with an ineffably bored expression, leaned against the wall gazing down onto the mobile head of another man who was energetically sucking him off. It spoke of a vast sexual indifference that was, if anything, more dispiriting than the meat market around the cubicles. Look on, stranger, I’m only making love.

Dances were held there on Saturday nights as a manifest of “Our Place” as opposed to the Mafia-run gay bars in other parts of the city. For two dollars’ admission one could spend an evening immersed in tribal rites, with all the soda or beer one could drink. The street floor of the firehouse was the dance floor, with a circular staircase the Second-floor lounge and soda bar. The basement in Stygian darkness, included chairs, tables, and another soda bar.
<br><br>						
The whole building, on Saturday nights, pulsed with the beat of rock music, but the main action was on the dance floor. When Lamont, Vernon, Michael, and I were going over there, it was early June, 1971, and hot, since the Firehouse didn’t have air conditioning. The higher the temperature went, the more clothes came off, down to the briefest of hot pants. The music blasted. The bodies writhed. The sweat poured. And the beat went on. Observing the melee from halfway up the circular staircase left no doubt in my mind about what was happening. It was a war dance. The contrast to the dancing at Christopher’s End and other dance bars was obvious. At the bars dancing was, by and large, part of the whole cruising process and had a sense of display about it. People danced for other people to see them and hopefully appreciate what they saw. Although plenty of cruising went on at the Firehouse, the dance floor wasn’t the place for peacock displays, but a celebration of post-Stonewall identity. “We are. We are together. And if you don’t like it, fuck off.” ",

I got to know [Alfred C.] Kinsey in 1948 - his book came out a month after The City and the Pillar; and the shocked New York Times would not advertise either. For a time, Dr. Kinsey used the mezzanine of the Astor as a sort of office, where he would interview ""human males"" about their sex lives. I think that the somewhat phlegmatic Dr. Kinsey was secretly delighted by this warrior display, and I like to think that it was by observing the easy trafficking at the Astor that he figured out what was obvious to most of us, though as yet undreamed of by American society at large: Perfectly ""normal"" young men, placed outside the usual round of family and work, will run riot with each other. <br>

,,New Yorkers,,,Ellington,,"Duke Ellington: New York is a dream of a song, a feeling of aliveness, a rush and flow of vitality that pulses like the giant heartbeat of all humanity. The whole world revolves around New York, especially my world. Very little happens anywhere unless someone in New York presses a button!<br>New York is its people, and its people are <i>the city</i>. Among its crowds, along its streets, and in its high-piled buildings can be found every mood, sight,and every sound, every custom, thought, and tradition, every color, flavor, religion, and culture of the entire earth. It is as if each of the world’s greatest chefs had sent a pinch of his nation’s most distinctive flavoring to contribute to the richness of taste of this great savory <i>pot au feu</i> called New York.<br>The miracle of the city is that this concoction, with its multitude of dissimilar ingredients, can sometimes come to the boil, and sometimes simmer away contentedly on the back of the stove. Since it is at the mercy of so many cooks, it is often stirred up, and, too often, of late, over-seasoned by some heavy-handed pepper wielders. But this gorgeously aromatic pot never burns or sticks to the bottom! Instead, New York presents itself as a proper feast to each human being of healthy appetite who hungers for soul food. Whether his needs are nutritional or merely “gourmet,” the hungry one is fed, for in New York it is all there on the menu, that something to satisfy every taste: exotic, traditional, or adventuresome. Perhaps it is at this very moment of finding his soul food listed on the menu that the next New Yorker is born. For the “real New Yorker” is not always born in New York, you know. He becomes one at the very instant when he discovers that his own ingredients are completely compatible with the city’s soups and salads.<br>I am that kind of New Yorker, for I was born in Washington, D.C. And ifI am asked to describe New York, I must think in musical terms, becauseNew York is people, and that is what music is all about. This incredible city embraces all humanity within its structure, whether resident or visitor, and joins each new heartbeat with her own throbbing pulse. For personified, New York is a woman, and as such she is a little of everything. Certainly, she isa sophisticate. Sometimes she is a lady of the evening. To her cosmopolitan visitors, she is always a gracious hostess deferential to their differing points of view. And like a true Earth Mother, she rests but never sleeps. She is the last to retire at night and the first to rise with each new day, for she suffers from an exhaustingly active energy called Anticipation!<br>In his ideal image, the real New Yorker is seen at the newsstand after midnight with the <i>News</i> under his arm, but it is also considered extremely prestigious to be seen reading the <i>Times</i> on the subway in the morning. On his way home from work in the later afternoon, always with the <i>Post</i> in his pocket, the New Yorker looks as though he has been some place, and knows it.<br>It is impossible to enter New York without feeling that something wonderful is about to happen. Whether you arrive by plane, ship, train, car or bus, bridge or tunnel, you feel the immediate excitement of starshine. For to this great city come the world’s Beautiful People; men of wisdom and good intent; people of cultures older than our own, with highly cultivated tastes; creative geniuses in all fields of endeavor; exquisite women of fashion; great ladies of all ages, whose beauty lies in their genuineness; and all are essential parts of the melody line in this dream of a song that is New York. This is a city of talented performance. Everyone in New York is a performer, down to the most casual visitor. Perhaps Shakespeare had a vision of Manhattan in mind when he wrote that “all the world’s a stage,” for most certainly we all get caught up in the plot!<br>There is a kind of highly contagious fever of backstage communication about New York. The opportunities to rub elbows with the “stars” are so many and frequent that a little of that glamour dust of starshine clings to everybody.There are almost no “bit players” on Manhattan Island. Everybody is a star.If this statement seems extravagant, then just consider the taxi driver. No greater Solon exists than the New York cabbie. He <i>knows</i> something about everything, and his is the only gossip column worth reading. He is part ofthe pulse of the people, of the beat and throb of the city, for he knows, he really knows what is happening in New York, from his own point of view and everyone else’s. He speaks a “people” wisdom and at the heart of this great cosmopolitan city is a vital, small-town “peopleness.” Have you ever been in New York during a disaster or a blizzard? It becomes the friendliest place in the world! That blew fuse, the blackout, was the friendliest of all, because nine months later the stork flew in over the horizon with a bumper crop of babies.<br>So amid all her tickertape and traffic, New York is the dream of a song. New York is a place where the rich walk, the poor drive Cadillacs, and beggars die of malnutrition with thousands of dollars hidden in their mattresses.",,
,,New Yorkers,,,"Fitzgerald, My Lost City",,"Then I understood—everything was explained: I had discovered the crowning error of the city, its Pandora’s box. Full of vaunting pride the New Yorker had climbed here and seen with dismay what he had never suspected, that the city was not the endless succession of canyons that he had supposed but that it had limits— from the tallest structure he saw for the first time that it faded out into the country on all sides, into an expanse of green and blue that alone was limitless. And with the awful realization that New York was a city after all and not a universe, the whole shining edifice that he had reared in his imagination came crashing to the ground.",,
,,New Yorkers,,,Menken,,"Manhattan Island, with deep rivers all around it, seems an almost idealscene for a great city revolution, but I doubt very much that there is any revolutionary spirit in its proletariat. Some mysterious enchantment holdsits workers to their extraordinarily uncomfortable life; they apparently get a vague sort of delight out of the great spectacle that they are no party of. The New York workman patronizes fellow workmen from the provinces even more heavily than the Wall Street magnate patronizes country mortgage-sharks. He is excessively proud of his citizenship in the great metropolis, through all it brings him is an upper berth in a dog kennel. Riding along the elevated on the East Side and gaping into the windows of the so-called human habitations that stretch on either hand, I often wonder what process of reasoning impels, say, a bricklayer or a truck driver to spend his days in such vile hutches. True enough, he is paid a few dollars more a week in New York than he would receive anywhere else, but he gets little more use out of them than an honest bank teller. In almost any other large American city he would have a much better house to live in, and better food; in the smaller towns his advantage would be very considerable. Moreover, his chance of lifting himself out of slavery to some measure of economic independence and autonomy would be greater anywhere else; if it is hard for the American workman everywhere to establish a business of his own, it is triply hard in New York, where rents are killingly high and so much capital is required to launch a business that only Jews can raise it. Nevertheless, the poor idiot hangs on to his coop, dazzled by the wealth and splendor on display all around him. His susceptibility to this lure makes me question his capacity for revolution. He is too stupid and poltroonish for it, and he has too much respect for money. It is this respect for money in the proletariat, in fact, that chiefly safeguards and buttresses capitalism in America. It is secure among us because Americans venerate it too much to attack it.",,
,,Night Walks,,,Ellington,,"Night Life is cut out of a very luxurious, royal-blue bolt of velvet. Itsparkles with jewels, and it sparkles in tingling and tinkling tones. Someof its sparkles are more precious than precious stones; others are just splashes of costume jewelry. Night Life seems to have been born with allof its people in it, the people who had never been babies, but we’re born <i>grown</i>, completely independent. Some of them were wonderful people, and some were just hangers-on of the sort. Some of them experienced untold misfortunes, and some of them were lucky. Some of them glittered in Night Life even more brightly than their names on the marquee. Some played sure things, others were inclined to gamble. There were a few hustlers, who were dependent upon finding suckers for survival. And there were some who were too wise to hustle, who only wanted to have enough money to be able to afford to be a sucker. Nightlife had a song and dance. Nightlife was New York ... Uptown, downtown, Harlem ... Anywhere where they wore that gorgeous velvet mantle.<br>But something seems to have happened to Night Life ... Broadway is a one- way street.<br>I’ve worked nightspots ever since the beginning of my piano-plunking career, but I’m proud to say that I’ve never hustled a man. Back in the old days when I first came to New York, I worked at Barron’s (Barron Wilkins’s joint was at 134th Street and Seventh Avenue, and it was considered absolutely the <i>top</i> spot in Harlem), which catered to big spenders, gamblers, sportsman,and women, all at the peak of their various professions. People would come in who would ask for change for a C-note in half-dollar pieces. At the end of the song, they would toss the four-bit pieces up in the air, so that they would fall on the dance floor, making jingling fanfare for the prosperity of our tomorrow. The singers—four of them, including Bricktop—would gather up the money, and another hundred-dollar bill would be changed, and this action would go jingling deep into the night. At the end of the evening, at 4 A.M. or maybe 6, when our bountiful patron thought we had had enough setting-up exercises picking up halves, he would graciously thank us and wish us good luck. With our “See you soon again, baby,” we looked forward to, and wished for, his good health and happy return.",,
,,Night Walks,,,Cather,,"On this blue May night, it is music. It is not the Prologue to Pagliacci, which rises ever and anon on hot evenings from an Italian tenement on Thompson Street, with the gasps of the corpulent baritone who gets behind it; nor is it the hurdy-gurdy man, who often plays at the corner in the balmy twilight. No, this is a woman’s voice, singing the tempestuous, over-lapping phrases of Signor Puccini, then comparatively new in the world, but already so popular that even he recognized his unmistakable gusts of breath. He looks about over the roofs; all is blue and still, with the well-built chimneys that were never used now standing up dark and mournful.",,

The generous feeling in it was stopped by a rigid perspective, a single center of action, and by jokes with only one side to them. If one overlooked that, what was interesting was the peremptoriness and the paranoia of Marxism as a ferment or method of rhetoric. But artists who looked at painting were used to a brilliance in such a method on the part of the Paris surrealists and to a surrealist humor that the political talk did not have. Politically everybody downtown was anti-fascist, and the talk went on peacefully. Then when friends who had fought in Spain returned, their silence made an impression so direct that the subject was dropped. Against everybody’s intention it had become shameless.
      In the presence of New York at the end of the thirties, the paranoia of surrealism looked parlor-sized or arch. But during the war Bill told me he had been walking uptown one afternoon and at the corner of 53rd and 7th he had noticed a man across the street who was making peculiar gestures in front of his face. It was Breton and he was fighting off a butterfly. A butterfly had attacked the Parisian poet in the middle of New York. So hospitable nature is to a man of genius.",

Afro-European?), two clearly Caucasian, and two unclear or mixed; for that matter, it was very likely that all of them were mixed. The contrasts in ideas were striking, too. At the far left, a punklike blond boy with an Axl Rose look held an ATTITUDE placard. Next, a voluptuous Asian girl held RACE. An olive-skinned boy carried a TRUTH sign. A black girl had a POWER sign. A short, compact Asian man signed LIES. At right, the youngest-looking of the six, a girl with a gamine aura, covered herself with FIRST DATE. It was impossible (or let’s say very hard) for a spectator not to enjoy the near nakedness of these kids, to feast our eyes on them. At the same time, the way the sign was crafted, it was impossible
not to feel guilt and embarrassment. The sudden vision of their bodies was revelatory and shocking. There was something about the way they stood, the ambient light and color, the innocence on their faces when innocence was mixed with defiance—that made them seem vulnerable and overexposed; they looked more like suspects in a police lineup than participants in an orgy. But what was their crime? There was human depth in this sign, it drew us into the action. Before the picture could mean anything, we spectators had to imagine actively, to “write the book.” My wife and I imagined a strip search after a drug raid on a club. We noticed that at least two of these kids were “underage,” but we couldn’t tell what the age spread was supposed to mean. Was the point that age meant nothing? (But then, I thought, shouldn’t there be some older people with wrinkled or sagging bodies in the scene?) We never figured out their genital signs, fig leaves in print. Were we meant to think of those tags as social labels imposed by the powers that took their clothes and lined them up? Was this a generation of kids caught in the crossfire of adult big words? Yet wasn’t “victim” another adult big word?",

Years later I asked somebody who’d been around a lot then where exactly all the speed had been coming from, and he said, “At first, they got all their speed from Rotten, but then his speed got so bad he wouldn’t even touch it himself, and from then on, everybody got it from Won-Ton.” That was a name I’d heard a lot, but I’d never laid eyes on him.

Voguing evolved into a contorted, jerky, slicing style of dance when drag queens incorporated kung fu aesthetics into their routines, having become familiar with the swift, angular movements of Bruce Lee and his co-stars while working trade inside Times Square’s porn cinemas, or heading there after a night’s work to get some rest.				
<br><br>
In broad daylight, voguers headed to the abandoned stretches of the West Side piers, where they would hang out and practice moves, or to the clandestine space of gay-driven dance venues such as Better Days, the Paradise Garage and Tracks.

In the early 1980s, leaving my house to go to balls at 3:30am was really just a bit too much. My family argued with me about going out, they were like, “Are you crazy? Where you going at this time?” And I would reply, “I’m leaving Brooklyn, riding the West Side Highway up to Harlem, looking at the sunrise, and then I’m going to a ball.” It was like a drug, you had to go, and you had to wait to the end for the grand prize. It was like, “You have to see Miss Avis come out there, honey.”
<br><br>					
Not because I didn’t appreciate the Harlem Renaissance or my roots, I just didn’t like that 4 o’clock, 5 o’clock in the morning lifestyle. It almost felt to
me like it was as if gay people shouldn’t be seen, so let’s go out in the wee hours of the morning and play around and do our thing, then run home before people can see us. I think it was a little safer for some of the drag queens back then, because they liked coming out when it was dark. But when they came downtown, I picked an area where people could feel safe, wear their fur coats and didn’t have to worry about this, that and the other.

I walked in Brooklyn, in the worst neighborhoods, in red leather pants, red leather shoes, beige sheepskin, beige shoes, finger-wave hairstyle and Gazelle glasses.

How many places are as widely (or instantly) recognizable as New York? Older films sometimes placed a printed title across the view; newer ones rarely do—but in any case the name has always been superfluous. Like Big Ben or the Taj Mahal, the New York skyline is one of the world’s unmistakable icons, thanks in large part to films themselves: each new opening shot trades on—and reinforces—the skyline’s preexisting fame. Unlike those other icons, though, the skyline carries civic as well as national significance, standing for a city as much as (or more than) a country. And unlike the others it is not just a single structure but an entire place—the very thing, in fact, being symbolized. The Eiffel Tower denotes Paris; the skyline not only denotes but is New York.<br><br>Of course, the skyline also denotes something else: the “big city,” the endless metropolis. This turns out to be less a function of the skyline’s vertical thrust, surprisingly, than its horizontal spread: its hundreds upon hundreds of buildings, with their thousands upon thousands of windows— each window providing the symbolic marker of an individual and so, by extension, an individual story. Over the next few hours, the skyline vista suggests, we will follow one such story—but we might well have turned to some other window and there found another, equally interesting story to watch. Next time, perhaps. There are, the skyline proposes, millions of stories to choose from—a whole city of stories, all proceeding at once, whether we happen to see them or not.<br><br>Some establishing shots try for more, searching the skyline for clues about the story to come. The image that starts <i>Young Man with a Horn</i> (1950) gazes high up at the Chrysler Building, soaring into the sky as confidently as the jazz trumpeter on the soundtrack rises into his upper register. But soon the camera begins to tilt down, descending roof by roof to the modest tenement apartment of piano player Hoagy Carmichael, the film’s narrator. This turns out to be a sketch of the film itself—a struggle between the transcendent “high note” that cornetist Kirk Douglas dreams of reaching and the worldly complexities of life and love that threaten to wreck his career. An identical shot, opening <i>Miracle in the Rain</i> (1956), offers a simpler meaning: New York, as the narrator tells us, is home to not only the high and mighty (the skyscrapers) but to millions of ordinary people—including Jane Wyatt, a tenement dweller who is the film’s romantic lead. Barbara Stanwyck’s smoky voice—over at the opening of 1949’s “East Side, West Side” “Yes, this is my town ... the most exciting city in the world, they say, the (glamorous, the most frightening, and above all, the fastest ... ”) underpins a glide from the sleek towers of midtown to a modest apartment house on Gramercy Park (“for me, it’s home”), again evoking the distinction between the celebrated and the ordinary—and the city’s embrace of both.<br><br>The same kind of movement is elsewhere turned to very different purpose. Among other things, the New York skyline remains an abiding symbol
of American wealth and power; an opening that shifts from the gleaming spires to a slum district effectively reminds the audience that the wretched conditions they will be sharing over the next few hours are to be found not in some obscure locality but in proximity to a national landmark. Over time, the simple tilt or pan from proud skyscrapers in the distance to shabby tenements nearby (in <i>Street Scene</i>, 1931, and <i>The Window</i>, 1949) has given way to the ambitious, planimetric aerial shots that open <i>West Side Story</i> (1961) and <i>
New Jack City</i> (1991), which, surveying all part of New York from above—as
if through a giant microscope—imply a kind of social-science objectivity, linking the city’s riches and poorest districts in a single socioeconomic system. ",

The painter is a licensed mess-maker. Sloan can enjoy the soiledand stained reality of New York because his own profession contributesto that festal grime. When writing his diary, he takes pleasure in his new fountain pen “which is making these marks” and sullying the paper. Withthe same comically scatological thrill, he records having taken deliveryof an expressed box of printing ink. Part of Robert Henri’s teaching was a messy and incontinent liberation of pigment. His students were taught to be unashamed of the filth they dabbled in, just as they were unembarrassed by urban ugliness. At the New York School of Art on West 57th Street they flung the leftovers from their palettes at a wall, which soon became impasted with an iridescent murk. Sloan concedes the alliance between paint and dirt when, on a walk through the East Side slums in 1906, he comments that the “grimy and greasy door frames” of the tenements look “as though huge hogs covered with filth had worn the paint away and replaced it with matted dirt.” Here paint and dirt compete, but they’re allies all the same. Paint is the accretion of sentiment, the varnishing of age and affection; dirt, too, testifies to use, wear, long familiarity. Dirt, like the spot on Yeats’s vest, vouches for the reality of things, as paint is trying to do.

It’s not a weighted, completed, obstructive thing, but a field of forces distributed through space. Not planted in earth, it unfolds in air, and the logic of its design suggests a similar engineering of society and history: man would be released from his servitude to material forces if only those forces could be operated on, directed, articulated. The bridge is built in time as much as in space. It’s a passage into the future as well as a conduit across a river.

Subway passengers became aware of posters with large, engaging pictures of the people you’d least expect chewing through a hunk of Levy’s. And if they looked authentic, that’s because they were authentic: “We wanted normal-looking people, not blonde, perfectly proportioned models. I saw the Indian on the street; he was an engineer for the New York Central. The Chinese guy worked in a restaurant near my midtown Manhattan office. And the kid we found in Harlem.

These ads were startling for the simple reason that such people weren’t usually seen starring in advertising. New Yorkers reveled in it, demanding copies of the Levy’s posters as well as the bread.

Frank O’Hara and two other people came to visit Andy in that house on Eighty-ninth Street and Lexington Avenue. It was very chicly decorated at the time—black vinyl walls, a horse from a carousel. I remember Andy saying that Frank walked into that front room and just started laughing and putting him down for being chi-chi. That’s not what they wanted to see or what they thought was important. He told me, ‘Frank was so meeeean.’ That carried through when he became a famous artist. But then at some point Frank made a change and thought that what Andy was doing was valid.”",,

There was but one thing for me to do: I took to my bed, and finally sleep intervened upon my physical misery.
